# nc_AFM package readme

This package is meant to be an example package to serve as a template for assignment 10 of the Physics 201: Data Analysis for Physicists course at Harvard in Spring 2020.

This package is meant to analyse the data acquired from non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy, (might) including 
# the determination of z_axis offset 
# the convertion between measured vibration frequency to force 
# the force composition analyses(Lennard-Jones Force, electrostatic force and van-der-waals force etc.) 
# and (might) also provide the analysis between different tip-sample geometry.
