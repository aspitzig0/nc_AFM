# nc_AFM package readme

This package is for assignment 10 of the Physics 201: Data Analysis for Physicists course at Harvard in Spring 2022.

This package is meant to analyze the data acquired from non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy (nc-AFM), including :
a) the convertion between measured vibration frequency to force 
b) the force composition analyses(Lennard-Jones Force, electrostatic force and van-der-waals force etc.)
c) the determination of z_axis offset
d) and (might) also provide the analysis between different tip-sample geometry.
